I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer, proud mom of a gorgeous 2-year old and an aspiring tech writer.

I started my career as a Java backend engineer, but most recently I focused on the UI, developing my skills as a Front-End Engineer, with technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux and a bit of CSS.

I plan to keep this up to date with my latests projects.

At the moment, I would like to highlight:

 * movierama: [site](https://lilicaway.github.io/movierama/) - [repo](https://github.com/lilicaway/movierama) - [demo](https://movierama-lilicaway.herokuapp.com/)
   * It is a basic movie catalog that uses the [tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) api.
     It was an assignment project from a company I applied to recently. What makes it special is that it was done without any JavaScript nor CSS frameworks. 
 * TypeScript-Babel-Webpack-Starter: [site](https://lilicaway.github.io/TypeScript-Babel-Webpack-Starter/) - [repo](https://github.com/lilicaway/TypeScript-Babel-Webpack-Starter)
   * It is a template project to create an app using TypeScript without any JS frameworks.
     It is the basis for the movierama app from above.
   * It is based on Microsoft's
[TypeScript-Babel-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter)
with ideas for Webpack based on sweetcoco's
[webpack-babel-boilerplate](https://github.com/sweetcoco/webpack-babel-boilerplate).

You can check out other projects I have on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lilicaway) profile. You can find older projects in Java and Javascript (with React/Redux 
and other things I was playing with)
