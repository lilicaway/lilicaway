I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer, proud mom of a gorgeous 2-year old and an aspiring tech writer.

I started my career as a Java backend engineer, but most recently I focused on the UI, developing my skills as a Front-End Engineer, with technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux and a bit of CSS.

Under construction
